[11/6/25, 12:26:31 AM] Neha: ^^^ GUYS: sign up here! INCREDIBLY useful for your demos that are just a couple weeks away, i want everyone to make the most possible progress
[11/6/25, 10:04:20 AM] ~ Usman: can everyone just start cleaning up after themselves and act like an actual adult or just don’t go into the fucking kitchen if you can’t cleanup
[11/6/25, 10:04:29 AM] ~ Usman: the kitchen literally stinks rn
[11/6/25, 10:05:40 AM] ~ Usman: and for fuck sakes stop leaving knives out at the edge of the tables anyone can get injured

[11/6/25, 11:54:08 AM] Neha: thank you to usman, max, camilo

makar, shivi?, martin, sunny please do better this month
[11/6/25, 11:57:48 AM] ~ Martin: There is a difference between writing m which is wiping the crumbs on the floor and vacuuming the whole 1st floor for 30 minutes
[11/6/25, 11:58:01 AM] Neha: as a reminder: there are NO dishes allowed in the sink. if the dishwasher is full, you must hand wash your dishes. we have a sponge and dish soap for a reason. the sink should be empty from now on. hate that we have to do this guys!

as another reminder: NO FOOD should go on the left side of the sink. the disposal is on the RIGHT, and you should make sure that food goes IN the disposal. to whoever left pasta shells and other food gunk in the sink, you know exactly who you are, and i hope you know better for next time.
[11/6/25, 12:00:21 PM] Neha: i think most people are not using that option and are labeling correctly, but i think we should spend more time focusing on cleaning the kitchen instead of vacuuming for the most part :) the kitchen is more important!
[11/6/25, 12:08:37 PM] Neha: also, i left a few dishes in the sink from the counter as i was cleaning (after i washed a lot of dishes & the sink) so @⁨~Martin⁩ or @⁨~Natalie Ma⁩ can you pls do them? i believe the others lower on the list aren’t home rn
[11/6/25, 12:16:00 PM] ~ Natalie Ma: sure

[11/19/25, 11:40:35 AM] ~ Nick Linck: *reposting from chapter 6 - sf chat* incase some of you are not there:

Great work everyone! Got so many compliments about yalls presentations 🥹🫶

🚨🚨Info for tomorrow. READ EVERYTHING🚨🚨

arrive by 4:30 at actioners. It will be the same run of show, guests arrive at 5pm and presentations start at 5:30pm.

You can come to actioners early and practice from the room.

🚨🚨WHAT IS CHANGING 🚨🚨

1) No residents will be in the audience, we have more people signed up for tomorrow than we did today

2) presenters will wait in the basement or behind the stage when they are NOT presenting. People talking in the other rooms is distracting to investors trying to listen.

3) presenters will enter through the back door so we can make sure no one misses their slot…

4) for the surprise, we will match you with investors as they are leaving the room, so again you do not need to be in the room

But again, great work everyone! I have no doubt investors will be writing checks tomorrow 🥳

[11/21/25, 8:50:07 PM] Mackay: Hey guys this is the official residency thanksgiving. No Sunday dinner as we have this for the week!
[11/22/25, 4:35:31 PM] ~ Usman: are the heaters in the house central controlled?
[11/22/25, 5:42:18 PM] Neha: yes but they are kind of weird since it’s an old house. you should actually switch off the radiator (turn the knob so water doesn’t go through it) if you want to fully turn off the heat (the central heat settings don’t fully turn them off)
[11/22/25, 5:43:14 PM] Neha: and don’t mess w the central heat settings as it increases our utility cost (bc the heating is not very efficient)
[11/22/25, 5:57:46 PM] ~ Jules Foa: Crepes party begin at 7:30!!
For anyone wanting some crepes lets clean up the kitchen to have a nice place to enjoy 🥞🥞

[11/22/25, 10:11:47 PM] Neha: guys hike starting tomorrow morning at 11 am :) we are going to marin/redwoods area

[11/24/25, 3:45:20 PM] Neha: hey guys, please remove your items from the blue couch, anything left will be thrown out if unclaimed by EOD today! sofas are for sitting not storing items :)
[11/24/25, 3:51:01 PM] Mackay: ‎This message was deleted.
[11/24/25, 3:53:44 PM] Mackay: Everyone, the kitchen has been super messy lately.

- Dishwashwer
-Don’t leave open
-Rinse chunks off dishes
-Don’t leave dishes facing up

* Trash
-Press down the trash with a wrapper so it’s compacted
-Don’t leave food waste open / pouring out the top
-Close the lid

*Generally, put dishes away and pick up crumbs/vacuum.

The cleaners are coming this wee and they charge based on the level of mess. If you don’t clean up the excessive mess you will be charged additional fees for the cost of the housekeepers.

Please fix these things today.
[11/24/25, 3:54:03 PM] Mackay: Thumbs up if you’ve read this, otherwise I will ask you directly

[11/25/25, 1:54:27 PM] Mackay: Cleaners are coming tomorrow, so expect a higher bill for cleaning which is unfair to those who do clean up or aren’t here

[12/8/25, 10:21:34 AM] Neha: and this whisk from 3 (!) days ago *still* has not been cleaned and now it is quite difficult to clean. which could have been solved by rinsing it immediately after use. as people are supposed to do. and also no longer works!!!
[12/8/25, 10:29:06 AM] Neha: no they haven’t come in yet 🥲 will check
[12/8/25, 10:32:39 AM] Neha: just cleaned out the battery compartment and it works now. let this be a lesson to please clean up after yourselves!!
