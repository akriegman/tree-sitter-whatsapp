# tree-sitter-whatsapp

A tree-sitter grammar for WhatsApp conversation transcripts. I made this for use in [ChatSkiBiDi](https://chatskibidi.com). Note that WhatsApp transcripts are not meant to be parsed, so they have lots of ambiguities. In those cases we just make an opinionated choice about what's more likely. We also make the syntax more permissive in some places, eg allowing extra whitespace where WhatsApp would only ever put a single space or newline.

I ended up deciding not to use this and just use regexes. Also, I realized there's a use case that's not covered by regexes or tree-sitter: pattern to pattern matching. Say you have a text stream and you want to know if the text you have so far _might_ match a pattern once completed. This is the same as matching the pattern to `/prefix.*/`. For ChatSkiBiDi I had to make a separate regex for incomplete headers. I'm pretty sure that pattern-pattern matching has the same complexity as pattern-string matching. In fact, I would not be surprised if every pattern-pattern matching problem could be translated into a pattern-string matching problem.
